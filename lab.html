              The mission of the Oladunni Lab is to create reliable and
              explainable AI systems that improve human health and decision
              making. We advance scientific understanding through innovative
              research, high-quality publications, and real-world impact. We
              also train students to become capable, ethical, and
              forward-thinking contributors to the computing field.

            <h3>Lab Overview</h3>
            <p>
              The Oladunni Lab focuses on advanced research in artificial
              intelligence, machine learning, and computational modeling. We
              design methods that are interpretable, resilient, and grounded in
              real data, with a strong emphasis on biomedical signal analysis
              and trustworthy AI. Our work combines algorithm development,
              multimodal learning, and rigorous evaluation to solve meaningful
              problems in cardiovascular health and population-level risk
              detection.

        <p>Educating students is important for the advancement of society in creating new innovations and developing new technologies. Not only is student education important on a large, macroeconomic scale, it is also important in individual growth and advancement applied on a microeconomic scale for continuing economic stimulation and expansions in various industries. Developing a strong student performance, due to the large impact education can have on certain students' and opening up their opportunities in certain industries, is often important for a person's future career growth in addition to economic and social status, regardless of gender, age, income level, weight, or ethnicity.</p>

        <p>This project is designed to process continuous speech spoken by people from the various axis in the world and to differentiate among their specific languages that are included in the training dataset. The success of this algorithm could have a huge impact on the technology space by catering for different tonalities and accents in speech technology. It is important to note that while speech recognition technology has been used extensively to enhance the quality of living for individuals with disabilities, the motivation for the project highlighted in this paper is the former (controlling digital devices).</p>

        <p>The purpose of this study is to accelerate the research to assist the vehicle in adopting AI and computer vision on the systems. The study is inspired by the concept of convolutional neural networks (CNN) using open source libraries like OpenCV and Keras. From the result, the model successfully identifies traffic sign, road lane, and adopt speed limits with very high accuracy. Applying AI on vehicles will play a more significant role in reducing road-related accidents and death.</p>

        <p>Churn prediction estimates whether the user will continue to use a service or no longer use it. If a company can use this effectively, it can be used in various strategies for promotion. Particularly in the case of mobile games that use advertising-based revenue model as a business model. The number of users directly affects the profits, so it can be utilized more effectively. In this study, will examined the effectiveness of neural networks in churn prediction using real data from a mobile game that uses advertising-based revenue model. We experimented to see the effect of the neural networks on the churn prediction using mobile game's data. And although there were some differences in the experiment, it was confirmed that the overall neural network performed well. In this experiment, the algorithm with best performance was LSTM. Although only mobile game data is used here, the results of this study can be applied to other user-based businesses. In addition, the results obtained through such churn prediction can be used in various ways to improve the profits of the company.</p>

        <p>Stock Market trading can be predicted through political events, news headlines, and general sentiments around companies in real time. We experimented prediction of stocks with machine learning algorithms. The Radial Basis Function being nonlinear had the best output that most resembled the shape of the data selected. The Linear graphs and Polynomial graph showed a linear curve and was mostly not able to pinpoint the prices. The LSTM function was able to grasp the shape of the graph but could not pinpoint any particular data points and was slightly off by some amount. The loss for this model was 0.0012 after 100 epochs. The MLP Classifier outputs a loss function which gives the amount of error handled in the running of the program. The minimum loss of the MLP was 0.00719235 after 51 epochs.</p>

        <h2>Marzieh Savadkoohi</h2>
        <p>This work investigates the balance pattern of human subjects through the force-plate measurements. Four different 60s quiet standing tests of eyes-open/firm surface, eyes-closed/firm surface, eyes open/foam, eyes-closed foam performed by 163 participants in three trials. Totally 12 force-plate files were recorded for each subject with the sampling rate of 100 Hz. The dimension of data for each individual subject is thus 72000 rows by 9 columns. Different Deep Learning Algorithms were used in this work to discriminate between human subjects and detect balance impairment. MLP, CNN and RNN were used as learning algorithms with classification accuracy of 99.8%, 99.6% and 96.9% respectively.</p>

        <p><strong>Bank Industry stock prediction using LSTM</strong></p>
        <p>Analyzing stock prices is very difficult due to the uncertainty and their dynamic nature. Investors use many statistical techniques such as moving average, Relative Strength Index (RSI) and others to make buying or selling decision on stocks investment. Stocks price are times series data which is a model that deals with a sequence of measurement of a same variable based on series of time. In this paper, we evaluate the stocks using an econometric approach using granger causality which is a methodology used in econometric to analyse short- or long-term dependency in binary or multivariate data. Another technique of analysis that is also beneficial for investors is the prediction. The second of econometric used in the study is the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA). Finally The study experiments a deep learning approach using the Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) which also cops with sequences of prediction using historical information and the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) which is a class of feedforward artificial network. In this research, we conduct a predictive analysis of historical stock price data of three banking industry stocks of New York Exchange (NYSE) which are JP Morgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo. We first evaluate their long-term relationship using their logarithm returns and follow by the prediction method. Based on the results obtained from the three methods meaning the LSTM, ARIMA and MLP, we conclude that LSTM outperforms ARIMA and MLP on the prediction.</p>
